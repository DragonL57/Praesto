                <p className="text-sm mb-1"><strong>SAM (Serviceable Available Market):</strong> Students, educators, developers, SMBs, and price-sensitive professionals in English-speaking and ASEAN markets seeking affordable, tool-centric AI solutions (tens of millions of potential users).</p>
                <p className="text-sm mb-1"><strong>SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):</strong> Target capturing a specific, growing percentage of SAM over 3-5 years (e.g., 50k-100k paying users).</p>
                <p className="font-semibold text-sm mt-2 mb-1">Investor Critique:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>SOM Justification:</strong> How will this obtainable market share be achieved against incumbents and new entrants? What is the unique go-to-market strategy for these specific segments?</li>
                  <li><strong>Niche Definition:</strong> While the &quot;affordable agentic AI&quot; niche is currently less saturated, how defensible is it? Larger players could introduce similar tiered offerings. UniTaskAI needs to rapidly build brand loyalty and a unique feature set (e.g., the Artifact system).</li>
                  <li><strong>Market Penetration in ASEAN:</strong> Specific strategies are needed for ASEAN market penetration, considering language, local partnerships, and payment gateways.</li>

                <p className="text-sm mb-1"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Achieve profitability by scaling the user base, optimizing CAC to LTV ratio, increasing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) through upselling to higher tiers or valuable add-ons, and carefully managing operational/API costs.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold text-sm mt-2 mb-1">Investor Critique:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> Close monitoring of CAC, LTV, churn rate, ARPU, and API cost per user will be vital. What are the target values for these metrics?</li>
                  <li><strong>Scalability Challenges:</strong> Beyond technical scaling, can the business model scale efficiently? As features and tools are added, complexity and costs can rise. How will this be managed?</li>
                  <li><strong>Exit Strategy (Long-term):</strong> While early, any thoughts on potential long-term exit opportunities (acquisition by larger tech player, etc.) can inform strategic direction.</li>

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-6">
              <strong>Overall Viability Assessment (Investor View):</strong> Moderate to High Potential, contingent on strong execution. UniTaskAI addresses a clear market need for affordable, practical AI. However, success depends critically on:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm mt-2">
              <li>Securing initial funding and managing burn rate effectively.</li>
              <li>Aggressively acquiring users and achieving target conversion rates.</li>
              <li>Continuously innovating on the toolset (especially the Artifact system) to maintain differentiation.</li>
              <li>Rigorously managing API costs to ensure sustainable unit economics.</li>
              <li>Building a strong brand and community to create a moat in a competitive market.</li>
            </ul>
            The &quot;Market Pull&quot; approach reduces initial market creation risk, but competition will be fierce. The team&apos;s ability to iterate quickly and manage costs will be decisive.
