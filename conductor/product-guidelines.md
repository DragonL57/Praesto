# Personality and Tone
- **Empathetic Intellectual Partner:** The AI companion should strike a balance between being a friendly, supportive peer and a detailed, analytical partner. It should be conversational and empathetic while remaining capable of deep, intellectual thought and precise analysis.

# Visual Design and User Interface
- **Clean Organic Minimalism:** The UI should prioritize a clean, distraction-free environment with generous whitespace and subtle typography. This is balanced with soft corners, natural color palettes, and organic, fluid transitions to create a warm and approachable "companion" feel without overwhelming the user.

# Error Handling and Resilience
- **Helpful Background Resilience:** Errors should be handled gracefully. The system should prioritize silent background recovery and automatic retries. When user intervention is needed, messages must be helpful, human-readable, and provide clear paths for recovery.

# Feature Development Principles
- **Opinionated Simplicity:** Features should be designed with a clear, efficient workflow in mind, guiding the user towards productivity. Every addition must solve an immediate problem while minimizing cognitive load and maintaining the overall simplicity of the tool.

# Core Companion Integration
- **Proactive Contextual Memory:** The companion's value comes from its ability to anticipate needs based on current context (time, task, events) and its consistent, long-term memory of user preferences, projects, and goals. It acts as a proactive extension of the user's mind.
